This is my Artificial Intelligence lab project. The project is a Checkers Game built using Pygame and Python, incorporating advanced AI techniques to enhance gameplay. The game integrates genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic analysis, and the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for intelligent decision-making.

Features:
  1. Challenging AI Opponent: Utilizes genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic for adaptive gameplay.
  2. Efficient Decision-Making: Employs minimax and alpha-beta pruning for optimal moves.

Technology Used:
  1. Python
  2. Pygame: For game development and rendering.
  3. Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Logic: For intelligent game evaluation.
  4. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning: For efficient decision-making.
